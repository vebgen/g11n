# g11n-cli

This is a command line tool for g11n. It should be installed as a
development dependency of your project and run as part of your build
process.

It's purpose is to scan your source code for strings that need to be
translated and generate a set of JSON files. These JSON files are then used by
the g11n library to provide translations.
